# Project Graph

## Intent / Purpose

### Background - Programme Parts

A large and complex programme can have many moving parts which are essential to delivery of the whole, but these parts are represented by differing sets of artefacts and internal controls, each of which can be changing. A relatively simple example, based on some of the components of DEFRA's Farming & Countryside Programme is shown below in @ProgComp

![ProgComp](Images/System-Space-1.png){#fig-ProgComp}

Taken in isolation, each part has it's own set of rules, and ways that progress can be evaluated or measured

Understand impacts - get an end-end view, but cut out all of the noise. Today it is done by people knowing

Be able to model impacts

### Co-ordination across the Programme

However, these different parts are actually intrinsically linked, and the co-ordination

### Software Aims - Design Principles

-   To be as configurable as possible

-   To be usable by anyone without needing to have software developers involved at every step

Built using smaller modules

## Data Sets

### Table names for the master data.

HR = Human readable, G = Graph
